Where it comes from?
====================
Writing an embedded Groovy DSL for end users which can read as plain English. What a crazy idea!

The starting point was when working in Amadeus, on a language aimed a Travel Agent. 
Business requiremrent was: **I want something simple, something I can understand.** 

That's when I fell in love with Groovy. 
DSL are so elegant and powerfull.
