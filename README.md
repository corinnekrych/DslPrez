Where it comes from?
====================
Writing an embedded Groovy DSL for end users which can read as plain English. What a crazy idea!

The starting point was when working in Amadeus, I was asked to design a domain-specific language aimed a Travel Agent.

From business point of view, requiremrent is: 

**I want something simple, something I can understand.** 

Digging how I can quickly design a languge that fit reavel agent, I discover Groovy.
That's when I fell in love with Groovy. DSL are so elegant and powerfull.
With this presentation I want to share with you our journey into the world of DSL coding.

Corinne.
